# Order of Database Tables
Database tables created from tableschemas must be done in a particular order to avoid missing foreign key errors.

## Tableschemas are split into two categories: core classes and relational classes
* Core classes are standalone concepts that form the basis for the entire model. They may be related to other tables, but conceptually stand alone without dependencies
* Relational classes depend on related tables for context and represent relationships between the core classes. In relational schemas, these are represented as intermediary tables used for many-to-many relationships.
Names of relational classes are compound terms where the core classes in the relationship are concatenated together.

Core classes are created first followed by the relational classes.
